# Honey Bee Lifecycle ready-reckoner.

A simple reckoner to allow easy calculation of future dates in the lifecycles of honey bees and varroa mites.

## Instructions

1. Print off and cut out the three wheels.
2. Pin either of the smaller wheels over the larger one.
3. Rotate to line up the start of a cycle with a date.
4. Solid lines are fixed periods, dashed lines represent average periods.

**Note** : Dates lie on the dashes, not the spaces.
